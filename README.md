# disaster-prediction
This is an attempt at the Kaggle Competition Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview<br>
I used Getting started with NLP for absolute beginners (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners)<br>
as a guide, modifying it to classify instead of being linear.<br>
Output gets 0.823, which is ~320 on the leaderboard.<br>
Hasn't been iterated on at all.
